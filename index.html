            <h2>NASA Voyager reaches the edge of our solar system and makes unprecedented discovery that humans will never be able to see</h2>
            <p>NASA has revealed that they have sent a man-made machine further than they ever have before, and they said they made an odd discovery in the process.

Back in 1977, NASA sent two space probes into space, Voyager 1 and 2, with the intention of exploring the outer reaches of the solar system.

A rather lofty goal, but the space agency has revealed that not only has it done this, but it found a region of space where things get a little weird.

Essentially, the probes have reached a point where solar winds collide with the interstellar winds and temperatures absolutely skyrocket.

But first, let's back up. According to the space agency, there are many different ways to define the ‘edge’ of our solar system.
It can be defined as where the planets end, or at the Oort cloud or the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence where objects may still return closer to the Sun.</p>

            <h2>NASA Says Launch Of Shubhanshu Shukla's Axiom Space Mission Likely Tomorrrow</h2>
            <p>After repeated delays, NASA has now announced that Indian Astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla could fly to space tomorrow.

This is the shortest turnaround time from announcing a new date and the targeted launch that NASA announced. This is the sixth new date that NASA has announced.  

NASA, Axiom Space, and SpaceX are now targeting 12.01 PM (India Time), Wednesday, June 25, for launch of the fourth private astronaut mission to the International Space Station, Axiom Mission 4.

The mission will lift off from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The crew will travel to the orbiting laboratory on a new SpaceX Dragon spacecraft after launching on the company's Falcon 9 rocket. The targeted docking time is approximately 4.30 pm (India Time) Thursday, June 26. 

There have been multiple delays since the first launch date was announced as May 29, 2025. Initially the postponements were linked to inclement weather issues which is normal for Florida weather, subsequently SpaceX announced they had detected technical glitches on the first stage of the Falcon-9 rocket which included issues with a thruster and leak of the oxidizer. It turned out that there was a leak of Liquid Oxygen and initially SpaceX wanted to do a 'band aid' type fix and launch within 24 hours, at that point the Indian team led by Dr V Narayanan, Chairman, of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) wanted a full repair and validation.

            <h2>SpaceX, NASA delay launch of crewed Axiom Space mission again</h2>
            <p>WSpaceX had reset the countdown clock for its next human spaceflight, but a NASA decision has forced another delay of the private Axiom Space Ax-4 mission to the International Space Station.


NASA stated it needed more time to evaluate a recent repair to a years-old leak to the Russian side of the station.

"Because of the space station's interconnected and interdependent systems, NASA wants to ensure the station is ready for additional crew members, and the agency is taking the time necessary to review data," NASA stated in a Thursday update.

So what had been a planned early Sunday morning launch was called off with NASA stating a new launch target will be made in the coming days.

Launch opportunities run daily through June 30 for a Falcon 9 rocket topped with a new Crew Dragon capsule launch from Kennedy Space Center and take four private astronauts to space.

The mission would be the fourth trip to the station for Axiom Space and second commanded by former NASA astronaut and current Axiom employee Peggy Whitson. This would be her fifth trip to space including her NASA missions, which so far have totaled more than 675 days in space.

She's leading three customers from three nations that have not sent an astronaut to space in more than four decades. Taking the role of pilot is India's Shubhanshu Shukla, while Sławosz Uznański of Poland, a European Space Agency project astronaut, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary are mission specialists.

The quartet plan to spend about two weeks on board the space station performing more than 60 experiments, including some partnered with NASA.

            <h2>NASA tech to use moonlight to enhance measurements from space</h2>
            <p>NASA will soon launch a one-of-a-kind instrument, called Arcstone, to improve the quality of data from Earth-viewing sensors in orbit. In this technology demonstration, the mission will measure sunlight reflected from the moon— a technique called lunar calibration. Such measurements of lunar spectral reflectance can ultimately be used to set a high-accuracy, universal standard for use across the international scientific community and commercial space industry.

To ensure satellite and airborne sensors are working properly, researchers calibrate them by comparing the sensor measurements against a known standard measurement. Arcstone will be the first mission exclusively dedicated to measuring lunar reflectance from space as a way to calibrate and improve science data collected by Earth-viewing, in-orbit instruments.

"One of the most challenging tasks in remote sensing from space is achieving required instrument calibration accuracy on-orbit," said Constantine Lukashin, principal investigator for the Arcstone mission and physical scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

"The moon is an excellent and available calibration source beyond Earth's atmosphere. The light reflected off the moon is extremely stable and measurable at a very high level of detail. Arcstone's goal is to improve the accuracy of lunar calibration to increase the quality of spaceborne remote sensing data products for generations to comes"</p>

            <h2>Mysterious space signal traced to long-dead NASA satellite</h2>
            <p>A brief but extremely powerful radio signal thought to have coming from deep space has now been traced to a dead NASA satellite in Earth orbit.

Relay 2 was one of a pair of experimental communications satellites, the first launched in 1962 and the second in 1964.

The signal from the decommissioned satellite was picked up in June last year—and it lasted less than 30 nanoseconds.

Despite the fleeting nature of the burst, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope. managed to trace it back to its origin.

Radio signals from space are not an uncommon occurrence; in fact, telescopes pick up signals all the time coming from pulsars, black holes, massive galaxies, stars and various other cosmic phenomena.

But far from being from a distant cosmic source, researchers determined that the fast radio burst (FRB) actually came from the 60's satellite in Earth orbit.

Relay 2 operated for just over a year and a half, at which point the only facility equipped to communicate with it—the Mojave Desert Ground Station—was retasked to a different satellite program.

The transponders onboard Relay 2 stopped responding to radio signals in June 1967, after which point the satellite went silent—until last June.

According to the researchers, Relay 2 did not miraculously come back online to send a signal to Earth. Instead, they believe that either an electrostatic discharge (ESD) or a plasma discharge following a micrometeoroid impact could have set off the burst.</p>

            <h2>Space Myth Busted: NASA Confirms Earth's Largest Human-Made Structure Isn't What You Think</h2>
            <p>It's a persistent piece of trivia, often repeated in classrooms and casual conversations: "The Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure visible from space." It's a testament to the Wall's monumental scale and historical significance. However, despite its enduring popularity, NASA, along with astronauts who have spent time orbiting Earth, has repeatedly and definitively debunked this long-held belief.

"While the Great Wall is indeed an incredible feat of engineering, it simply isn't wide enough, or distinct enough in color from its surroundings, to be easily visible to the naked eye from typical orbital altitudes," explains Dr. Lena Karlsson, a space educator and communications specialist. "From hundreds of miles up, it largely blends in with the natural landscape."

Astronauts often confirm this, noting that while features like major highways, large bridges, or even very large agricultural patterns can sometimes be glimpsed under specific lighting and atmospheric conditions, the Great Wall typically remains elusive, especially without the aid of powerful binoculars or specialized cameras. Its narrow width and construction from materials that often match the color of the local terrain make it notoriously difficult to spot from orbit.</p>
